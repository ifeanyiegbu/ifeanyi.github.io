## Projects

### CASUAL AI: Generating casual graphs using large language models(Ongoing Thesis project)
The project involves leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract causal graphs from unstructured data. The project aims to enhance automation by developing prompt engineering techniques, generating structured graphs, and implementing a search functionality within the generated causal graphs. The focus is on measuring the degree of automation achievable, necessitating thorough prompt design and evaluation methodologies to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the automated extraction process.

This research explores creating 3D objects using "3D Generative Adversarial Networks" (3D GAN). The method employs adversarial networks and volumetric convolutional networks. Unlike traditional methods, it captures object structures implicitly, generates high-quality 3D objects without reference images, and uses an unsupervised discriminator for 3D shape description. Experiments confirm its ability to produce top-notch 3D objects and achieve competitive results in object recognition compared to supervised learning methods.

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for plant disease detection. Training involves the 'fit()' function with parameters like dataset splitting, shuffle, and callbacks. The 'ReduceLROnPlateau()' function adjusts learning rates when progress slows down. Evaluation metrics on the test set show high accuracy (96.39%), precision (96.74%), recall (95.92%), and AUC (99.78%).

In this project, four models were initially examined to predict the Air flight price ticket. Further analysis was carried out by using Ensemble methods to improve performance of the model. After Hypertuning the parameters, the best model was selected. The model achieved an accuracy of 88% which is an improvement on related work done by Amar Mandal who achieved 81% accuracy.

This project introduces the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier for predicting fake job posts online. Utilizing natural language processing and various techniques like word cloud representation and lemmatization, six models were tested, with Random Forest outperforming others. LSTM's lower accuracy suggests it's not ideal, favoring supervised algorithms like Random Forest for this dataset with an accuracy of 96.81%.
