In this project, four models were initially examined to predict the Air flight price ticket. Further analysis was carried out by using Ensemble methods to improve performance of the model. After Hypertuning the parameters, the best model was selected. The model achieved an accuracy of 88% which is an improvement on related work done by Nikita Verma and Amar Mandal who achieved 87% and 81% accuracy respectively.
